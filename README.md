# Difference between Circuit Design and Spice 
  A basic difference between a circuit design and a spice simualtion would be, the circuit design would consist of logic gates and inverter blocks made up of pmos and nmos, and the Psice simulation would be a simulation tool which would involve simualting the circuits and verifying the output waveforms when an input waveform is provided.
